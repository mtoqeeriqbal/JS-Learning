## Data Types
## Primitive Data Types
Stored directly in the "stack", where it is accessed from
- String - Sequence of characters. Must be in quotes or backticks
- Number - Integers as well as floating-point numbers
- Boolean - true or false / Logical entity
- Null - Intentional absence of any object value
- Undefined - A variable that has not yet been defined / assigned
- Symbol - Built-in object whose constructor returns a unique symbol
- BigInt - Numbers that are greater than the 'Number' type can handle.
## Non-Primitive Data Types
Stored in the heap and accessed by reference
- Arrays - 
- Objects -
- Functions - 



## Static typing vs Dynamic types
- Javascript is a dynamically-typed language. This means, we do not explicitly define the types for our variables. Many other languages are statically-typed such as C, C++ and Java
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which allows static-typing. This can make your code more verbose and less prone to errors. TypeScript may be something you want to look intot later on.
